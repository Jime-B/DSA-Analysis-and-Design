# DSA-Analysis-and-Design
In these projects, I designed a course management system for ABCUâ€™s Computer Science department that allows advisors to access course information, retrieve prerequisites, and display an ordered course list. To achieve this, I explored different data structures and concluded that a hash table was a better structure since it provided fast lookup, insertions and optimal prerequisite verification.

Throughout the project, I encountered challenges such as file parsing errors, hash table collisions, and sorting complexities. I addressed these by implementing robust error handling, using chaining to manage collisions, and extracting course numbers for alphanumeric sorting. This experience reinforced the importance of selecting the right data structure based on client's needs balancing runtime complexities. It also sculpted my approach to software design by emphasizing modularity, maintainability, and scalability. I also developed a clearer and more adaptable programming style by writing structured, reusable functions that ensure that my code remains efficient and easy to upgrade in the future.
